# Week Two Research
In week two I focused on two main topics:

1. **CVE-2025-33073** – a Windows SMB privilege escalation vulnerability.  
2. **Access Token Manipulation (T1134)** – techniques for abusing access tokens in Windows environments.

This folder contains my research notes and breakdowns for both topics.
