# Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
As a cybersecurity professional, we can dive into technical details all day, but when it comes to interacting with business leaders or non-technical stakeholders, being able to speak in their language is critical. Understanding Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) helps bridge that gap and ensures that security decisions align with business objectives.

## What is GRC
Governance, Risk, and Compliance is an integrated framework that ensures:  

- **Organizational objectives are achieved: Governance**  
Objective: What are the goals we are trying to achieve? Governance provides direction and oversight to make sure these goals are met efficiently and ethically.  

- **Risks are identified and managed: Risk Management**  
Risk: How are the assets identified, how can we protect them, and what’s most or least important? Risk management identifies potential threats, evaluates impact, and prioritizes mitigation.  

- **Regulatory and legal obligations are met: Compliance**  
Compliance: The legal and regulatory standards we must follow to remain in line with government and industry requirements.  

**Core Objective:**  
The main goal is to align IT, security, and business strategy so that technical and business operations support each other effectively.

### Why GRC Matters
Without proper GRC, organizations face multiple risks:  

- **Protects organizational reputation:** Non-compliance can damage trust, negatively affecting business.  
- **Prevents financial penalties:** Regulatory fines can be severe if obligations are not met.  
- **Enables business continuity:** Compliance ensures operations can continue smoothly under regulations.  
- **Improves decision-making:** Shared understanding of risks and policies allows for more informed, consistent decisions.  
- **Builds stakeholder trust:** Stakeholders trust organizations that follow recognized baselines and industry standards.  
- **Reduces uncertainty:** Clear governance and risk frameworks allow for proactive rather than reactive responses.

# Networking Fundamentals
## Why Networking Fundamentals Matter
- Ever attack crosses a network: Most attacks exploit network vulnerabilities to access systems.  
- Every detection relies on traffic: Security monitoring depends on analyzing network flows and logs.  
- Cloud = networking abstraction: Cloud resources are accessed over networks, making network knowledge essential.  
- Logs mean nothing without packet understanding: Understanding raw traffic and packet flows is crucial for accurate threat detection.  

Tools like SIEMs and packet analyzers monitor network traffic, detect anomalies, and track attack paths. Network compromise, through techniques like ARP poisoning, ICMP attacks, or spoofing, can allow attackers to move laterally and access sensitive data.

## What is a Network?
- Devices connected to exchange data: Computers, servers, routers, switches, and other endpoints.  
- Nodes (hosts): Individual devices or endpoints in a network.  
- Links (wired/wireless): Physical or wireless connections enabling data transfer.  
- Protocols (rules of communication): Standards that define how devices exchange information.  

Network diagrams show connectivity between desktops, switches, routers, and the wider internet.

## How Data Moves
Visiting a website involves multiple network interactions:  
- **DNS resolution**: Converts domain names to IP addresses.  
- **TCP handshake**: Establishes a reliable connection between client and server.  
- **TLS negotiation**: Creates a secure, encrypted communication channel.  
- **HTTP request**: Sends GET/POST requests to retrieve or submit data.  
- **Data transmission**: Data moves across the network to the client.  
- **Connection termination**: Closes the session once communication is complete.  

Each step interacts with different layers of the protocol stack.

## OSI Model (Layer: Function: Security Relevance)
- 7. Application: User-level protocols (SQL injection, XSS attacks).  
- 6. Presentation: Encryption/encoding (TLS, SSL).  
- 5. Session: Session management (session hijacking).  
- 4. Transport: Reliable delivery (SYN flood).  
- 3. Network: Logical addressing (IP spoofing).  
- 2. Data Link: MAC addressing (ARP spoofing).  
- 1. Physical: Bits on medium (cable tapping).  

**Notes:** TCP handshakes occur at Layer 4, DNS lives at Layer 7. Physical tapping allows attackers to intercept unprotected traffic.

### TCP/IP Stack (Layer: Protocol Examples)
- 4. Application: HTTP, FTP, DNS  
- 3. Transport: TCP, UDP  
- 2. Internet: IP, ICMP  
- 1. Network Access: Ethernet, ARP  

This model simplifies the OSI stack by combining layers: Application merges OSI layers 5–7, Internet replaces Network, and Network Access includes both Data Link and Physical layers.

## IPv4 Addressing
- Structure: 32 bits (e.g., 192.168.1.10)  
- Binary format: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010  
- Address types:  
  - Unicast: One-to-one communication  
  - Broadcast: One-to-all communication  
  - Multicast: One-to-many communication  

## MAC Addressing and Ethernet
- MAC address: 48-bit hardware identifier (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)  

### **Ethernet Frame Structure:**  
- Destination MAC: Target device  
- Source MAC: Sending device  
- EtherType: Specifies protocol or media type  
- Payload: Actual data  
- Frame Check Sequence: Ensures frame integrity  

Layer 2 operates within the local broadcast domain.

## ARP Mechanism
Purpose: Resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses within a local network.  
Process:  
- Broadcast: “Who has 192.168.1.10?”  
- Target replies with MAC address  
- Entry stored in ARP cache  
- No authentication, vulnerable to spoofing  

## TCP Protocol
Ensures: reliable transmission, ordered delivery, flow control, congestion control.  

### **Three-way handshake:**  
- SYN: Client → Server  
- SYN-ACK: Server → Client  
- ACK: Client → Server  

**Connection termination:** FIN, ACK, FIN, ACK  

### **TCP header structure:**  
- Source/Dest ports: Identify the sending and receiving applications on the hosts.  
- Sequence number: Tracks the order of bytes sent for reliable delivery.  
- ACK number: Confirms receipt of data from the other side.  
- DO (Data Offset): Indicates where the header ends and data begins.  
- RSV (Reserved bits): Reserved for future use; must be set to zero or handled according to protocol.  
- Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN): Control connection establishment, acknowledgment, and termination.  
- Window: Specifies the amount of data the receiver can accept before sending an acknowledgment.  
- Checksum: Ensures integrity of the header and payload during transmission.  
- Urgent pointer: Marks data that requires immediate processing.  
- Options: Additional features or parameters, such as timestamps or maximum segment size.

TCP is like reliable mail delivery: ensures data arrives in order and intact.

## UDP Protocol
**Characteristics:** 
- No handshake
- no retransmission
- no ordering
- low overhead  

### Common Uses: 
- DNS
- Streaming
- Gaming
- VoIP  

UDP is faster but unreliable, trading reliability for speed.

## Ports and Sockets
- Port ranges: 0–1023 well-known, 1024–49151 registered, 49152–65535 ephemeral  
- Socket: IP + port + protocol (e.g., 192.168.1.10:443 TCP)  

Port scanning identifies exposed services.

## DNS
- Hierarchy: Root → TLD → Authoritative servers  
- Query types: A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), MX, TXT  
- Uses UDP port 53  

Example domain flow: thecyberledger.in → DNS servers → redirected to the app without exposing IP.

## IPv4 Header Fields
Version, Header length, Total length, Identification, Flags, Fragment offset, TTL, Protocol, Header checksum, Source IP, Destination IP  

TTL prevents infinite routing loops.

## Routing Concepts
- Routing table: Destination network, Next hop, Interface, Metric  
- Static vs Dynamic routing: RIP, OSPF, BGP  
- Routers forward packets based on the best match rule  

## NAT
Translates private IPs to public IPs:  
- Static NAT: Fixed mapping  
- Dynamic NAT: Variable mapping  
- PAT: Many-to-one mapping  
Conserves IPv4 addresses and hides internal network structure.

## Firewalls
- Packet filtering: IP/Port-based filtering  
- Stateful: Tracks connection states  
- Application: Inspects payload  
- Next Gen: Deep packet inspection + IDS/IPS  

Tools like Snort and Wireshark help monitor and analyze traffic.

## Wireless Encryption
WPA1-3 protects Wi-Fi networks.

## ICMP & Diagnostics
- ICMP functions: Ping, Destination unreachable, Time exceeded  
- Diagnostic tools: ping, traceroute/tracert  

ICMP attacks (echo/relay/reply) can cause DoS.

## TLS & Encryption Flow
**TLS Handshake:** Client hello → Server hello → Certificate exchange → Key exchange → Encrypted session begins  

### Protections: 
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Authentication

## Common Network Attacks  
- **Layer 2: ARP spoofing**: An attacker sends fake ARP messages to associate their MAC address with another host’s IP, allowing interception or modification of traffic within a local network.  
- **Layer 3: IP spoofing**: Forging the source IP address in packets to masquerade as a trusted host, bypass filters, or redirect traffic.  
- **Layer 4: SYN flood**: Overwhelming a target with TCP SYN requests without completing the handshake, exhausting resources and causing denial of service.  
- **Layer 7: HTTP flood, SQLi**: Application-level attacks; HTTP floods overload web servers with requests, while SQL injection manipulates database queries to extract or alter data.

Infrastructure attacks: BGP hijacking, DNS poisoning

## Packet Analysis Tools
Wireshark, TCPDump, NetFlow, ss, netstat  

Packet captures reveal: source/destination IP, protocol, TTL, fragmentation details, flags, sequence numbers, window size

## Network Segmentation & Security
- VLANs: Isolate network segments  
- Subnets: Split larger networks into smaller ones  
- DMZ: Separate zone between internal network and internet  
- Zero Trust Architecture: Minimize lateral movement and blast radius
